## Features

- **Bulk Email Sending:** Efficiently send bulk emails using Amazon SES.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilize AWS Lambda and EventBridge to handle email events such as bounces, complaints, and deliveries.
- **Scalable and Reliable:** Leverage AWS's scalable infrastructure to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **Easy Configuration:** Manage email templates and recipient lists using Amazon S3.

## Architecture

The architecture of this application is based on AWS's serverless services:

1. **Amazon S3:** Stores email templates and recipient lists.
2. **AWS Lambda:** Handles the processing of bulk email requests and email event notifications.
3. **Amazon SES:** Sends emails and reports back events like bounces and complaints.
4. **Amazon EventBridge:** Captures events generated by SES and routes them to Lambda functions for processing.
5. **IAM Roles**: Manages permissions for accessing AWS services.

## AWS Services Used

- **Amazon SES:** To send emails and handle email events.
- **AWS Lambda:** For processing email requests and event notifications.
- **Amazon S3:** To store email templates and recipient lists.
- **Amazon EventBridge:** To handle event-driven email processing.
- **AWS IAM**: To manages permissions for accessing AWS services.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with SES, Lambda, S3, and EventBridge services enabled.
- AWS CLI configured with the appropriate permissions.
- python installed for running Lambda functions (if using Node.js runtime).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tanay0608/Bulk_Email_Marketing.git
    cd Bulk_Email_Marketing-app
    ```

2. **Set up your AWS resources:**
   - Create an S3 bucket for storing email templates and recipient lists.
   - Set up an SES domain and verify your sender email address.
   - Create an IAM role with necessary permissions for Lambda.

3. **Deploy Lambda functions:**
   - Package and deploy the Lambda functions using the AWS CLI or an infrastructure as code tool like AWS SAM or Terraform.

4. **Configure EventBridge:**
   - Create rules in EventBridge to capture SES events and route them to the appropriate Lambda functions.

5. **Upload Email Templates and Recipient Lists:**
   - Upload your email templates and recipient lists to the S3 bucket.

6. **Configure SES for Event Handling:**
   - Set up SES to send bounce, complaint, and delivery notifications to EventBridge.

## Usage

1. **Upload a recipient list and email template to the S3 bucket:**
   - Upload a CSV file with the list of recipients to the designated S3 bucket.
   - Upload an HTML or plain text file as the email template.

2. **Invoke the Lambda Function:**
   - Trigger the Lambda function manually or through an API Gateway endpoint to start sending emails to the list of recipients.

3. **Monitor Email Events:**
   - Use CloudWatch logs or a designated monitoring system to track email events such as deliveries, bounces, and complaints.
